    Caused by the violent explosion of a volcano. It is caused by magma that is very high in silica, making it highly viscous. 
    This causes the gas to compress and become the cause of a violent explosion. This causes the lava to harden quickly so the mineral crystals do 
    not have time to crystallize. Therefore, it is a rock with very small crystals or almost no crystals. Looks like glass Obsidian is therefore called 
    glass granite. The stone is usually black in color and has a fine stone texture. Has hardness and sharp edges In ancient times, obsidian was used to make weapons. 
    When obsidian comes in contact with water, it forms white fibrous crystals. spread like snowflakes In Thailand, they are rarely found.

    <div class="text">Granite
    It is a complicated igneous rock. Faded colors are commonly found. Granite has a medium to coarse texture. 
    Sometimes single crystals that are larger than the groundmass are found, forming a rock known as porphyry. Granite can range from pink to dark gray or even black, 
    depending on the size. with chemical composition and mineral composition Granite outcrops tend to form a rock mass that forms a rounded surface. Granite sometimes 
    forms circular sinkholes surrounded by mountain ranges, forming contact metamorphism or hornfels.

    <div class="text">Basalt
    It is a commonly found igneous rock. They are often found to be gray to black in color. It has a fine texture due to the rapid cooling of lava on the earth's surface. 
    Two-sized bodies with larger crystals may be found in the fine-grained surface. or has a network of hollow flesh or volcanic slag (scoria). Fresh basalt is black or gray.

    <div class="text">Andesite
    It is a fine-grained stone. Mineral crystals are invisible to the naked eye. Because the mineral crystallizes quickly This causes the mineral crystals to be small, purple, green, dark gray, or black. They require a microscope to be diagnosed. They 
    are caused by cooled magma on the Earth's surface. They contain the important mineral, plagioclase feldspar. and dark minerals such as hornblende, pyroxene, and biotite.

    It is a type of igneous rock. It has a foamy and light texture. It has a light colored texture such as white. It is full of small pores and sometimes can float in water. The texture is not smooth. Because there is a model However, the texture is still glass.
     This is because the lava cools before the minerals can crystallize. Gases mixed in the meat cause small holes throughout the lump.

    <div class="text">Rhyolite
    It is an igneous rock formed from the cooling of very viscous lava. It has a silicic content of more than 66 percent and has a fine texture consisting of small mineral crystals. It has the same mineral composition as granite. But the crystals are so small that they cannot be seen. 
    Most are pink and yellow.
